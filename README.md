# Fun with fresh & deno

SSR of a list of "articles" from a static `json` datasource just for fun.
Checking out the `islands` concept.

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

### TODO

The actual interactive part... :)
